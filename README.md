# Homework Project Overview
This repository contains the second significant homework project I completed during my Web Development courses at Kauno Informacinių Technologijų Mokykla. The project serves as a test of my HTML and CSS skills, with a particular focus on responsive design using Boostrap classes and components, SASS and BEM. As part of the assignment, I was tasked with recreating the design of a restaurant website provided by the instructor.

## The Task
The task strictly required the use of HTML, CSS and Bootsrap only to recreate the design of the instructor's website.
Due to the nature of the assignment, which involved the instructor's personal work, I am unable to provide links or screenshots of the original page. However, for reference, I have included wireframes of the layout in the "task-layout-wireframes" folder within this repository. There are no wireframes for mobile because the task requires to use Bootsrap components that are responsive by default.

## Additional Details
To make the page more interactive, I added a couple of features that weren't described in the task. One of them is an embedded cart that holds demo items which could later be modified using JavaScript. Another item is the popups with custom messages that a user sees when they click on various buttons found across the website.

I used ChatGPT to generate the content such as titles, descriptions, color combinations, etc.
